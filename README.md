## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) - React framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For coding

### What I learned

Working with Grid components in MUI saves a lot of time!

### Continued development

Looking to refine best practices when it comes to theming components in MUI and properly configuring them.

### Useful resources

- [Mui Grid](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-grid/) - Very handy to use when you want to put components in a grid easily without having to deal with CSS Grid, etc.
- [MUI Toggle Buttons](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-toggle-button/#main-content) - Incredibily useful components when you want to toggle state on buttons.
